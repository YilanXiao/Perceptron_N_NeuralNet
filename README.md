# Perceptron_N_NeuralNet

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks - Perceptron and Neural Net.

Perceptron.ipynb - builds a perceptron in Python to perform handwriting recognition.

NeuralNet.ipynb - builds a multi-layer perceptron in Python with various activation functions.

This was part my favourite assignment during my Msc.
