# Perceptron_N_NeuralNet

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks - Perceptron and Neural Net.

The Perceptron notebook builds a perceptron in Python to perform handwriting recognition.

The NeuralNet notebook builds a multi-layer perceptron in Python with various activation functions.

This was part of the CS802 Deep Learning and Neural Net assignment during my MSc at the university of Strathclyde.
